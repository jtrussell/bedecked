# bedecked
## simple. portable. awesome. presentations.


## simple

Bedecked presentations are simple and that's a feature.

- Author with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) so
  presentations are dead easy to write and read
- [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) and vanilla html are supported too (try `bedecked help theme`)


## portable

The presentation html is built (sanely) for a single file

- Easy sharing with your public dropbox folder
- Opens in seconds on _any_ device with a modern browser

(go ahead, try your smartphone. I'll wait)


## awesome

We're embracing the awesome extensibility of [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) and bundling their most commonly used plugins out the box

- Try pressing `m` (btw you're on page 4 right now)
- Use `g` to quickly go to a specific slide

(you can configure these using the api, and hopefully soon with the cli as well)
